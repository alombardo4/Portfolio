## Timeframe
March 2014 to May 2015

## Description
Agendue is a cloud-based simple project management tool. It was designed with small businesses in mind and aims to simplify tracking projects with multiple collaborators. It is available for web, Android, and iOS. Users can create projects, share with teams, view and subscribe to a calendar of tasks, take notes from meetings, view project-based analytics, manage employee workloads, create tasks with assignments and due dates, and even leave bulletin board-style messages for other team members. It was free for personal, student, and non-profit use. We charged a subscription fee for any business customers. Agendue started development in early 2014.

Agendue was shut down in May 2015. The source code for all the applications has been made public on GitHub.
