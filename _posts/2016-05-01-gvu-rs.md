## Timeframe
Spring 2015

## Description
I created applications for the GVU Research Showcase, an event that occurs twice per year, once in the fall and once in the spring. The research showcase is used to display the current projects being worked on within the GVU Center at Georgia Tech. Previously, GVU used a booklet as the only method of viewing demo information. I created two companion apps, one for Android, and one for iOS. These apps provide all demo information, as well as maps, pulled dynamically from the GVU website. It is easier to browse than the booklet and contains much more information.
