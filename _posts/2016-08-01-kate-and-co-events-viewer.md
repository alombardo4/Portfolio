## Timeframe
Fall 2016

## Description
I was asked by Kate & Company to build an app for their clients to use on the day of their events. The app needed to have a management panel so that Kate & Company could input information about the event's activities and schedules for different groups, contact information, and news updates. The application system has a MEAN stack web application and backend as well as iOS and Android hybrid mobile applications created using the Ionic Framework.

Features include:

- User management
- Event and activity entry and viewing
- News system
- Contact system
- Management panel backend
- Full REST API
- Image upload
- Google/Apple maps links to event locations
- Printable event views
