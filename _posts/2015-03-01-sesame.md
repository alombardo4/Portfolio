## Timeframe
Spring 2015

## Description
Sesame is a Bluetooth LE bike lock designed and built for my CS 4605, Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing class. Sesame uses 2 solenoids connected to a microcontroller and Bluetooth LE module to unlock a standard U-Lock. I built an Android application to interface with the lock via Bluetooth. It is capable of maintaining a list of locks, setting passwords, changing names, and sending lock information to an Android Wear smartwatch. The watch can then unlock the lock on its own if the user’s phone isn’t present or is out of battery.

A video walkthrough is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/wpXPlbNYj8k). The Android app source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/alombardo4/BikeLockAndroid).
